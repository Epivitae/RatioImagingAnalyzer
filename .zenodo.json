  "title": "Ratio Imaging Analyzer (RIA): A Standalone, Zero-Dependency Tool for Robust Ratiometric Fluorescence Analysis",
  "description": "<p><strong>Ratio Imaging Analyzer (RIA)</strong> is a lightweight, open-source desktop application designed to streamline the processing of ratiometric fluorescence imaging data. Unlike complex image processing libraries that require scripting skills, RIA bridges the gap between raw data and biological insight through a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p><p><strong>Statement of Need:</strong></p><p>Quantitative analysis of time-lapse data remains a bottleneck for \"wet-lab\" experimental biologists. RIA addresses this challenge by offering an \"all-in-one\" standalone executable that runs on standard personal computers without requiring Python environment configuration.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>🚀 Zero-Dependency Portability:</strong> Distributed as a portable executable (.exe) to eliminate technical barriers for researchers.</li><li><strong>🧠 Robust Motion Correction:</strong> Integrates the Enhanced Correlation Coefficient (ECC) algorithm to automatically align image stacks and compensate for sample drift.</li><li><strong>✨ High-Contrast ROI Analysis:</strong> Features a custom multi-layered rendering system for Regions of Interest (ROI), ensuring visibility against complex fluorescent backgrounds.</li><li><strong>⚡ High-Performance Processing:</strong> Leverages <code>OpenCV-headless</code> and vectorized <code>NumPy</code> operations to replace heavier dependencies, ensuring real-time performance on consumer-grade CPUs.</li><li><strong>📉 Advanced Signal Processing:</strong> Implements custom <strong>Normalized Convolution</strong> for smoothing to prevent artifacts at image boundaries containing masked backgrounds.</li></ul>",
